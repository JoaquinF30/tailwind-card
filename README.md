# Description
Basic, uncomplete and not entirely accurate POC to tryout tailwind. 

## First thoughts
Dont like it very much. Thinking ahead about React components w/more funcionalities, the code may be too long and difficult to understand. This all without having tried it in a React complex environment...
On the good side, not having to go from one file to another (html/tsx, css/scss) it's an advantage. Also the primitive utilities are not so difficult to learn.
